## Client Payment Tracker

A Flutter application for managing client cash inflows and outflows. Track clients, record transactions, and view running balances with a simple, mobile-friendly UI.

### Features
- **Client management**: create, update, search, and list clients
- **Cash in/out entries**: add transactions with date, amount, and notes
- **Running balances**: see totals per client
- **Responsive UI**: works on Android, iOS, and Web (Flutter)

### Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (Dart)
- Platform targets: Android, iOS, Web, Desktop (optional)

### Getting Started
Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK installed (`flutter --version`)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- Android Studio/Xcode for emulators or a physical device

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>.git
cd Cash_in_out
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Run the app (choose one target):
```bash
flutter devices           # list available devices
flutter run               # run on the selected device
```

Run with a specific platform:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome     # Web
flutter run -d windows    # Windows Desktop (if enabled)
flutter run -d emulator-5554  # Example Android emulator id
```

Format, analyze, and test:
```bash
flutter format .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

### Building
Android APK/AAB:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or
flutter build appbundle --release
```

iOS (on macOS):
```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

Web:
```bash
flutter build web --release
```

Desktop (if enabled):
```bash
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
flutter build windows --release
```

### Project Structure
Key directories/files (Flutter standard):
- `lib/` – application source code
  - `screens/` – UI screens and pages (e.g., `client_list_page.dart`)
  - `widgets/` – reusable widgets
  - `models/` – data models
  - `services/` – data/storage/services
- `test/` – unit and widget tests
- `pubspec.yaml` – dependencies and assets

### Configuration
- Environment variables/keys: If the app integrates with remote APIs or databases, document required keys here (e.g., `.env` or platform-specific config). If the app is local-only, no extra configuration is needed.

### Screenshots
Add screenshots to `assets/screenshots/` and reference them here.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure Flutter is on a stable channel: `flutter channel stable && flutter upgrade`
- If Android build fails, accept licenses: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
- On Windows PowerShell, run commands in a terminal with developer tools (Android SDK) on PATH
- Run `flutter doctor -v` and resolve any reported issues
